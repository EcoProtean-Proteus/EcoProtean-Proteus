# EcoProtean Proteus 🌍

Hi! Welcome to **EcoProtean Proteus**, a project we started as two second-year IT students who want to combine our passion for tech with climate action and sustainability. This is our way of contributing to making the world a better place through code.

## 🌱 What We're About

EcoProtean Proteus is all about flexibility and adaptability, just like the mythological figure **Proteus**, who could change form. We believe we need to be flexible when solving environmental problems, especially with climate change being such a big issue.

Our goal is to:
- Help with **climate action** by using technology to raise awareness and provide solutions.
- Build **partnerships** between different people and organizations so we can work together to make a bigger impact.

## 🌐 What We Do

Some of the things we’re working on:
- **SustainAdapt**: A tool that helps people and businesses adjust to changes caused by the climate.
- **GreenLink**: A platform that connects people who want to collaborate on climate projects.
- **ProteanEco SDK**: A toolkit for developers who want to build apps focused on the environment.
